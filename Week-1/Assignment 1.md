> What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

When data is passed through the internet, it travels through multiple layers of stack, and each layer is responsible for a specific task.

For example, to access a new website the browser may need to make a DNS request. The protocols involved in multiple stacks are as follows:
Application Layer: DNS
Transport Layer: UDP
Network Layer: IP
Link Layer: Ethernet or Wireless LAN

Another example is when we have to access an HTTPS site, the protocol stack is as follows:
Application Layer: HTTPS
Transport Layer: TCP
Network Layer: IP
Link Layer: Ethernet or Wireless LAN


> What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

Some types of web servers are:

1. Web Server: Serves web content, handles HTTP requests, and supports dynamic web applications.
2. Database Server: Manages structured data storage, retrieval, and security.
3. Email Server: Handles email sending, receiving, and storage, using SMTP and IMAP protocols.
4. Web Proxy Server: Acts as an intermediary, caches web content, and enhances security.
5. DNS Server: Translates domain names to IP addresses, facilitating internet navigation.
6. FTP Server: Facilitates file transfer over a network using FTP protocol.
7. File Server: Stores and manages networked files for centralized access.
8. DHCP Server: Assigns dynamic IP addresses and simplifies network configuration.
9. Cloud Server: Deploys scalable virtualized server instances in cloud environments.
10. Physical Server: Provides computing resources through dedicated hardware.
11. Print Server: Manages and routes print jobs to networked printers.
12. NTP Server: Synchronizes network device time using NTP protocol.
13. RADIUS Server: Authenticates and authorizes remote user access to network resources.
14. Syslog Server: Collects and stores log messages for system monitoring and analysis.
15. Application Server: Hosts and manages software applications and services, handling client requests and data.

> What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?

Web hosting refers to the service of storing and making websites accisible on the internet. Different types of web hosting services available on the internet are:
1. Shared Hosting - Multiple websites share the same server resources such as storage, memory and processing power.
2. VPS Hosting - Offers a virtual server dedicated to our hosting. Offers more flexibility and resources than shared hosting.
3. Dedicated Hosting - Entire physical webserver dedicated solely to our website, offering highest level of performance and security.
4. Cloud Hosting - Multiple servers work together to host a group of websites, offering scalability and reliablity. As cloud hosting can dynamically scale resources up or down.
5. Managed Hosting - The hosting provider takes care of updates, backups and security.

> What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

Scaling means increasing of our server's capacity to handle more users, traffic and requests. As website grows in popularity, it experiences increased load, leading to slower response time and potential crashes. Scaling ensures that our server remains excessible even during peak traffic.
There are two types of scaling:
1. Vertical Scaling - Adding more resources to our server, such as CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.
2. Horizontal Scaling - Adding more servers to our system.
