**Objective:** The objective of this assignment is to test the understanding of closures in JavaScript. 

**Instructions:** 

Write a program that demonstrates the use of closures in JavaScript. 

1. Create a function named "counter" that takes no arguments and returns a function. 
1. The returned function should increase a count variable by 1 and return its value each time it is called. 
1. Create two instances of the counter function and assign them to variables named "firstCounter" and "secondCounter". 
1. Call the firstCounter function five times and store the returned values in an array named "firstValues". 
1. Call the secondCounter function three times and store the returned values in an array named "secondValues". 
1. Print the arrays 

**Example output:** 

firstValues array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] secondValues array: [1, 2, 3] 

**Desired Coding Practices:** 

1. Code should be indented properly. 
1. Code should be readable. 
1. Code should handle any edge cases foreseen. 
1. Add comments wherever required. 
1. Follow meaningful naming conventions, avoid generic naming conventions such as a,b,c,x,y,z etc.
