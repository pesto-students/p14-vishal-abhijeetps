Create an object called game in the script.js file. Modify the game object: 

- Add 2 properties: lives - initially 3, and coins - initially 0. 
- Add a getter called points that returns coins \* 10. 
- Add a playerDies() method that subtracts 1 from lives if lives is greater than 0. 
- Add a newGame() method that sets lives to 3 and coins to 0. 

The script.js file includes several console.log() statements, which should match the output below if the game object works correctly. 

lives = 3 coins = 0 points = 0 points = 20 lives = 2 lives = 0 lives = 3 coins = 0
