Write the function calcWordFrequencies() in script.js that uses the JavaScript prompt() function to read a list of words (separated by spaces). The function should output those words and their frequencies to the console.

Ex: If the prompt input is:

hey hi Mark hi mark

the console output is:

hey 1

hi 2

Mark 1

mark 1

Hint: Place unique words in a map, where the key is the word, and the associated value is the word's frequency.

To test the JavaScript in your web browser, call the calcWordFrequencies() function from the JavaScript console.
