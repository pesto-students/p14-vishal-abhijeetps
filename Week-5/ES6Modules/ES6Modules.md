Create two separate JavaScript modules - calculator.js and index.js. 

1. calculator.js module should have two functions - add(a, b) and subtract(a, b) that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum and difference respectively. 
1. index.js should import the add() function from calculator.js and use it to add two numbers and log the result to the console. 

Then, index.js should import the subtract() function from calculator.js and use it to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console. 

**Example output:** 5 // result of 2 + 3 -1 // result of 2 - 3 

**Hint**: Make sure to export the functions from calculator.js using export keyword and import them using import keyword in index.js. Remember to use relative paths for the import statements.
