**Real World Practice Coding Question on Symbols:** 

In a banking application, you need to implement a function that generates unique transaction IDs. Each transaction ID should be a symbol that is not equal to any other transaction ID generated by the system. Write a function generateTransactionId that takes no parameters and returns a new unique transaction ID as a symbol. 

**Example usage:** 

const transaction1 = generateTransactionId(); console.log(transaction1); // Symbol(TRANSACTION\_ID\_1) 

const transaction2 = generateTransactionId(); console.log(transaction2); // Symbol(TRANSACTION\_ID\_2) 

const transaction3 = generateTransactionId(); console.log(transaction3); // Symbol(TRANSACTION\_ID\_3) **Hint:**  

- You can use the Symbol() constructor to create a new unique symbol.  
- You can generate a unique string for each transaction ID by concatenating a constant string with a unique number generated by incrementing a counter each time a new transaction ID is generated. 

**JavaScript Best Practices:** 

- Use descriptive function and variable names. 
- Use meaningful comments to explain your code. 
- Avoid using global variables whenever possible. 
- Use the const keyword to declare variables that won't be reassigned. 
- Follow the principle of least privilege by making variables and functions as private as possible.
